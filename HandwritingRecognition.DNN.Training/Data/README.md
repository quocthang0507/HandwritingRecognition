# About this dataset

> This repository contains the MNIST dataset in JPG format. 
> The converted files in JPG format is attached in a zip file. There is one folder each for Testing and Training 
> I made this when I was playing around with MNIST and trying to understand ML. There was I think a repo that converted files to PNG. I wanted to test and train on JPG files and hence this simple python script. Since I didnt think the code would need further development, I have included a zip file of all the MNIST images. You can download and start using it straigtaway instead of bothering with the python file.
